#### This script allows to change default settings with which a video opens.

We can set speed, quality and enabling subtitles
globally or specialize for each channel, set opening videos in a new tab,
opening shorts as a default as default and
opening videos on artist channels with default speed.

English is the default language but if the YouTube interface language is Belarusian,
the settings popup is in Belarusian too.
