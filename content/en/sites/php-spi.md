#### My homework for the Programmer's Working Environment classes

### Content

There are multiple pages. Unfortunately, you can't see this on your own because
it has backend and I can't deploy this with github pages.

Routes are served by the .htaccess and the index.php files.

![home page](@/index.jpg)

The database page. Here we can see the grant id, date, grantor, grantee and
amount of money. ![database page](@/db.jpg)

The database editing page. We can delete, edit or add a grant.
![database editing page](@/edit-db.jpg)

If we click on "edytuj" or "dodaj", we are redirected to another page, then we
can click the submit button, and if entered data are correct, we'll be
redirected to the page with our data, otherwise we'll be redirected to an error
page. ![record adding page](@/add-db.jpg)

The search page. Here we can choose column by which we'll be searching and a
value. ![database search page](@/search-db.jpg)

The form page. Here we can input data and choose the kind of our NASTUP
participation, and then, we submit the form and move onto the next page.
![form page](@/form.jpg)

The next page is the page with our data and an image depending on our choice.
![form result page](@/form-result.jpg)
