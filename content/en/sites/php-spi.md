If we click on "edit" or "add", we are redirected to another page,
then we can click the submit button, and if entered data are correct,
we'll be redirected to the page with our data, otherwise we'll
be redirected to an error page.

The search page, here we can choose column by which we'll be searching
and a value.

The form page, here we can input data and choose
the kind of our NASTUP participation,
and then, we submit the form and move onto
