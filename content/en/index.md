## 👋 Hi, I'm Goose😋Ob
### A Frontend developer

The list of my projects is on the sidebar (or above if you're using phone),
there are the link to the github repo and the technology stack of a project on each
page. If there is no stack, the project's written only on JavaScript.

#### 😍If you want to hire me

My legal name is Edvin Dulko. Currently, I'm a computer science student of the
University of Lodz.

I can start working now, remotely or in Lodz, part-time

Languages I can speak:
- Polish
- Belarusian
- Russian
- English (probably B2, still working on this)
