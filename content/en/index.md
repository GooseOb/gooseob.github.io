## 👋 Hi, I'm Goose😋Ob

### A Frontend developer

The list of my projects is on the sidebar (or above if you're using phone),
there is a link to the github repo and a technology stack of the project on each
page. If there is no stack, the project's written only on JavaScript.

#### 😍If you want to hire me

My real name is Edvin Dulko. Now I'm a computer science student of the
University of Lodz.

At june I'll be 18yo, and it's the last month of an academic year, so I can
start working at july (or right now but in this case not full-time).

Languages I can speak:
- Polish
- Belarusian
- Russian
- English (started learning 1 year ago, still working on this)
