## 👋 Hi, I'm Goose😋Ob
### A Frontend developer

The list of my projects is on the sidebar (or above if you're using phone),
there is a link to the github repo and a technology stack of the project on each
page. If there is no stack, the project's written only on JavaScript.

#### 😍If you want to hire me

My real name is Edvin Dulko. Now I'm a computer science student of the
University of Lodz.

I can start working right now but not full-time.
June is the last month of an academic year
(and it's the month I'll be 18yo), so since july I can work full-time.

Languages I can speak:
- Polish
- Belarusian
- Russian
- English (started learning 1 year ago, still working on this)
